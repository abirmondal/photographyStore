# Enhancements

## Carousal Effect
The carousal effect *does not start automatically*, one has to start it manually. It is there in the **About Us** section of the webpage. Click next or previous button to start the carousal.

## Plugins Incorporated
I added a Google Map plugin. I made the iframe responsive so, it changes it's shape with screen resize.

## Sticky Footer
I actually did not make the full footer sticky but you can see a sticky button that is a part of the footer. It is the scroll to top button.

## Accessibility of the Page
I tried to make the page most accessible as possible. Below is the report from <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">Wave</a>. There you can see an **contrast error**. I think it is because of the Google Map iframe.

## Custom JavaScript
I created a pre-loader with JS and CSS. This will show before showing the content of the page.
